###  `2019/9/14` Maximum in a Stack

* recently asked by Twitter
```
Implement a class for a stack that supports all the regular functions (push, pop) and an additional 
function of max() which returns the maximum element in the stack
 (return None if the stack is empty). 
 Each method should run in constant time.

###  `2019/9/13` Invert a Binary Tree

* recently asked by Twitter
```

You are given the root of a binary tree. 
Invert the binary tree in place. That is, all left children should become right children,
 and all right children should become left children.
```

* solution:

###  `2019/9/12` Floor and Ceiling of a Binary Search Tree

* recently asked by Apple
```

Given an integer k and a binary search tree, find the floor (less than or equal to) of k,
 and the ceiling (larger than or equal to) of k. If either does not exist, then print them as None.
```

* solution:

```

###  `2019/9/11` Non-decreasing Array with Single Modification

* recently asked by Microsoft
```
You are given an array of integers in an arbitrary order. 
Return whether or not it is possible to make the array non-decreasing 
by modifying at most 1 element to any value.

We define an array is non-decreasing if array[i] <= array[i + 1] holds for every i (1 <= i < n).

Example:

[13, 4, 7] should return true, since we can modify 13 to any value 4 or less, to make it non-decreasing.
[13, 4, 1] however, should return false, since there is no way to modify just one element to make the array non-decreasing.
```

* solution:

```

###  `2019/9/10` Find the Non-duplicate number

* recently asked by Facebook
```
Given a list of numbers, where every number shows up twice except for one number, find that one number.

Example:
Input: [4, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 1
```

* solution:

```

###  `2019/9/9` Two-Sum

* recently asked by Facebook
```

You are given a list of numbers, and a target number k. 
Return whether or not there are two numbers in the list that add up to k.
Example:
Given [4, 7, 1 , -3, 2] and k = 5,
return true since 4 + 1 = 5.
```

* solution:

```

###  `2019/9/8` Sorting a list with 3 unique numbers

* recently asked by Google
```
Given a list of numbers with only 3 unique numbers (1, 2, 3), sort the list in O(n) time.

Example 1:
Input: [3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1]
Output: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]
```

* solution:

```


```
---

###  `2019/9/7` Reverse a linked-list

* recently asked by Google
```
Given a singly-linked list, reverse the list. This can be done iteratively or recursively. Can you get both solutions?

Example:
Input: 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 -> NULL
Output: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL
```

* solution:

```
