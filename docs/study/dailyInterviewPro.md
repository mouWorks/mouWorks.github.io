###  `2019/9/14` Maximum in a Stack

* recently asked by Twitter
```
Implement a class for a stack that supports all the regular functions (push, pop) and an additional 
function of max() which returns the maximum element in the stack
 (return None if the stack is empty). 
 Each method should run in constant time.

###  `2019/9/12` Floor and Ceiling of a Binary Search Tree

* recently asked by Apple
```

Given an integer k and a binary search tree, find the floor (less than or equal to) of k,
 and the ceiling (larger than or equal to) of k. If either does not exist, then print them as None.

###  `2019/9/11` Non-decreasing Array with Single Modification

* recently asked by Microsoft
```
You are given an array of integers in an arbitrary order. 
Return whether or not it is possible to make the array non-decreasing 
by modifying at most 1 element to any value.

We define an array is non-decreasing if array[i] <= array[i + 1] holds for every i (1 <= i < n).

Example:

[13, 4, 7] should return true, since we can modify 13 to any value 4 or less, to make it non-decreasing.
[13, 4, 1] however, should return false, since there is no way to modify just one element to make the array non-decreasing.

###  `2019/9/10` Find the Non-duplicate number

* recently asked by Facebook
```
Given a list of numbers, where every number shows up twice except for one number, find that one number.

Example:
Input: [4, 3, 2, 4, 1, 3, 2]
Output: 1
```

###  `2019/9/9` Two-Sum

* recently asked by Facebook
```
You are given a list of numbers, and a target number k. 
Return whether or not there are two numbers in the list that add up to k.
Example:
Given [4, 7, 1 , -3, 2] and k = 5,
return true since 4 + 1 = 5.

###  `2019/9/8` Sorting a list with 3 unique numbers

* recently asked by Google
```
Given a list of numbers with only 3 unique numbers (1, 2, 3), sort the list in O(n) time.

Example 1:
Input: [3, 3, 2, 1, 3, 2, 1]
Output: [1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3]

###  `2019/9/7` Reverse a linked-list

* recently asked by Google
```
Given a singly-linked list, reverse the list. This can be done iteratively or recursively. Can you get both solutions?

Example:
Input: 4 -> 3 -> 2 -> 1 -> 0 -> NULL
Output: 0 -> 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> NULL
```

###  `2019/9/6` First and Last Indices of an Element in a Sorted Array

* recently asked by AirBnb
```
Given a sorted array, A, with possibly duplicated elements, find the indices of the first and last occurrences of a target element, x. Return -1 if the target is not found.

Example:
Input: A = [1,3,3,5,7,8,9,9,9,15], target = 9
Output: [6,8]

Input: A = [100, 150, 150, 153], target = 150
Output: [1,2]

Input: A = [1,2,3,4,5,6,10], target = 9
Output: [-1, -1]

###  `2019/9/5` Validate Balanced Parentheses

* recently asked by Uber
```
Imagine you are building a compiler. Before running any code, the compiler must check that the parentheses in the program are balanced. Every opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket. We can approximate this using strings.

Given a string containing just the characters '(', ')', '{', '}', '[' and ']', determine if the input string is valid.
An input string is valid if:
- Open brackets are closed by the same type of brackets.
- Open brackets are closed in the correct order.
- Note that an empty string is also considered valid.

Example:
Input: "((()))"
Output: True

Input: "[()]{}"
Output: True

Input: "({[)]"
Output: False
```

###  `2019/9/4` Longest Palindromic Substring

* recently asked by Twitter
```
A palindrome is a sequence of characters that reads the same backwards and forwards. Given a string, s, find the longest palindromic substring in s.

Example:
Input: "banana"
Output: "anana"

Input: "million"
Output: "illi"
